Flutter Plugin for (collaborative) Augmented Reality - Supports ARKit for iOS and ARCore for Android devices.

Many thanks to Oleksandr Leuschenko for the [arkit_flutter_plugin](https://github.com/olexale/arkit_flutter_plugin) and to Gian Marco Di Francesco for the [arcore_flutter_plugin](https://github.com/giandifra/arcore_flutter_plugin) which both served as a great basis and starting point for this project.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Add the Flutter package to your project by running:

```bash
flutter pub add ar_flutter_plugin
```

Or manually add this to your `pubspec.yaml` file (and run `flutter pub get`):
# ar_flutter_plugin package extension

```yaml
dependencies:
  ar_flutter_plugin: ^0.7.3
```

### Importing

Add this to your code:

```dart
import 'package:ar_flutter_plugin/ar_flutter_plugin.dart';
```

If you have problems with permissions on iOS (e.g. with the camera view not showing up even though camera access is allowed), add this to the ```podfile``` of your app's ```ios``` directory:

```pod
  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        # Additional configuration options could already be set here

        # BEGINNING OF WHAT YOU SHOULD ADD
        config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
          '$(inherited)',

          ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
          'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1',

          ## dart: PermissionGroup.photos
          'PERMISSION_PHOTOS=1',

          ## dart: [PermissionGroup.location, PermissionGroup.locationAlways, PermissionGroup.locationWhenInUse]
          'PERMISSION_LOCATION=1',

          ## dart: PermissionGroup.sensors
          'PERMISSION_SENSORS=1',

          ## dart: PermissionGroup.bluetooth
          'PERMISSION_BLUETOOTH=1',

          # add additional permission groups if required
        ]
        # END OF WHAT YOU SHOULD ADD
      end
    end
  end
```


### Example Applications

To try out the plugin, it is best to have a look at one of the following examples implemented in the `Example` app:

| Objects & Anchors on Planes    | AR Scene in which tapping on a plane creates an anchor with a 3D model attached to it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Objects & Anchors on Planes Code](https://github.com/CariusLars/ar_flutter_plugin/blob/main/example/lib/examples/objectgesturesexample.dart)        |
| Object Transformation Gestures | Same as Objects & Anchors on Planes example, but objects can be panned and rotated using gestures after being placed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Objects & Anchors on Planes Code](https://github.com/CariusLars/ar_flutter_plugin/blob/main/example/lib/examples/objectsonplanesexample.dart)       |

| Screenshots                    | Same as Objects & Anchors on Planes Example, but the snapshot function is used to take screenshots of the AR Scene                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [Screenshots Code](https://github.com/CariusLars/ar_flutter_plugin/blob/main/example/lib/examples/screenshotexample.dart)                            |
| Cloud Anchors                  | AR Scene in which objects can be placed, uploaded and downloaded, thus creating an interactive AR experience that can be shared between multiple devices. Currently, the example allows to upload the last placed object along with its anchor and download all anchors within a radius of 100m along with all the attached objects (independent of which device originally placed the objects). As sharing the objects is done by using the Google Cloud Anchor Service and Firebase, this requires some additional setup, please read [Getting Started with cloud anchors](cloudAnchorSetup.md)        | [Cloud Anchors Code](https://github.com/CariusLars/ar_flutter_plugin/blob/main/example/lib/examples/cloudanchorexample.dart)                         |
| External Object Management     | Similar to the Cloud Anchors example, but contains UI to choose between different models. Rather than being hard-coded, an external database (Firestore) is used to manage the available models. As sharing the objects is done by using the Google Cloud Anchor Service and Firebase, this requires some additional setup, please read [Getting Started with cloud anchors](cloudAnchorSetup.md). Also make sure that in your Firestore database, the collection "models" contains some entries with the fields "name", "image", and "uri", where "uri" points to the raw file of a model in GLB format | [External Model Management Code](https://github.com/CariusLars/ar_flutter_plugin/blob/main/example/lib/examples/externalmodelmanagementexample.dart) |
